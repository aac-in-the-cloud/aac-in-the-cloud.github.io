  <p>This year for AAC in the Cloud we will be releasing some additional sessions at the end of the conference. We are calling these <b>compilation sessions</b>, because they will be a compilation of short clips collected from AAC in the Cloud participants. That means we need your help! You will also be entered in a drawing for an Amazon gift card if you submit a video clip.</p>

  <img src="/images/bulb.png" style='width: 220px; float: right;'/>
  <p>The idea with each of these compilation videos is to create a <b>series of messages speaking directly to AAC users, directly from AAC users, or both</b>! Most often presentations are targeted at therapists, teachers, aides, or family members, and some AAC users don’t feel comfortable or ready to share a whole session on their own, so we are hoping to help get some more direct support in both directions. In a way this is a continuation of the Lightning Talks we have hosted in years past.</p>

  <p>If you are recording a video to AAC users, it may feel a little disorienting to think about what you would say or how you would say it. Try to remember to say “you” instead of “they” and speak as if to an individual or to a group of AAC users. It may help to imagine a specific AAC user that you already know or are familiar with.</p>

  <p>Anyone may record for the first three prompts, but the last prompt is only for AAC users:
  </p>

 <ol>

  <li>Give some helpful advice to an approx. 10 year-old who seems curious but skeptical about adopting high-tech AAC into their communication toolbox.<br/><br/></li>


  <li>Share some realistic but empowering words with an approx. 16 year-old AAC user who isn't getting a lot of great support from the people around them.<br/><br/></li>


  <li>Share advice with an approx. 16 year-old AAC user that starts with one of the following phrases or something similar: "I know they say not to, but it's ok to..." or "Don't forget that you're allowed to..." or "I wish someone had told me sooner that...".<br/><br/></li>


  <li><b>If you are an AAC User</b>: Share what you would like the AAC support community to remember or learn that they may be missing or that you feel is important to bring up.<br/><br/></li>
</ol> 
 
<p>You don’t have to wait for the conference to begin to record your messages. Try to keep your message brief, not more than 3 minutes if you can help it (we reserve the right to clip and edit when creating the compilation video. If your video needs to be longer or intentionally includes wait times, please let us know). Once you have recorded your message, you can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AACintheCloud/posts/pfbid02NM4UiNbYtYJVF5pzXBVkiYNnFkTZHNCJPb2ZaFHyudKrXH8erLuf4vsXFi3pikcJl">share it on our Facebook post</a>, or <a href="mailto:info@openaac.org">email a link to it to info@openaac.org</a>. You can share it privately or post to your socials and send a link, whatever works best for you. You are not required to include your name, but if you want us to include you in the compilation’s “credits” then please do.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to email info@openaac.org and we can help you out!</p>
