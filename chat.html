  <p>AAC in the Cloud is a lot more than just a collection of friendly, informative sessions about AAC (though don’t get us wrong, those are pretty awesome by themselves).</p>

  <p>AAC in the Cloud is a chance to make new connections and have some fun while asking questions, sharing and learning together! Every live session has a chat room so participants can ask questions, share links and ideas, and collaborate as we learn together.</p>

  <p>In addition to all that conferencing stuff, we’ll do fun things too like emoji heroes (how would you describe your favorite superhero using only emoji?), superhero mask decorating, and other great things. We will use Slack to host our discussions.</p>

  <p>Looking for Tech Talk/Hack Night? Join the Slack channel and look for the #tech-talk channel to join the conversation on June 26 at 7pm ET, where we’ll be gathering to talk about AAC technology, software development, hardware, and maker projects!</p>
