	<h3>Everyone Deserves a Conference</h3>
	<p>AAC in the Cloud isn't the first AAC conference. There have been 
		great in-person, applied AAC conferences focused on practitioners
		or families that have helped many people sharpen their AAC skills
		and get started. However, those in-person conferences can only
		reach so many people, and only those who can afford to travel
		and attend. We're not alone in wanting to help spread the knowledge
		of best practices in AAC so families, teaching staff, practitioners
		and AAC users themselves can learn and improve.

	<h3>Keeping Things Open</h3>
	<p>
		With the power and freedom of the Internet, we can now open up
		an online AAC conference at very little cost that can be shared
		with as many participants as we can find. And best of all, YouTube
		just loves hosting videos for free, so we can keep all the past
		sessions up and open for all of us to keep learning year after year.
	</p>
	<p>
		We hope AAC in the Cloud can make a huge difference. There are so
		many people who can benefit from learning about new practices
		and perspectives, and who may need helping getting started on their
		AAC journey. We're so proud of all the presenters and moderators
		who done their time and energy to this free resource to the
		AAC community!
