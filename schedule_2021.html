  <h3>The 2021 Online AAC Conference is still available!</h3>
  <p>The fun never has to end! Technology can make such a difference in the lives of those with communication issues, and we hope this conference will continue to make a difference. The 2021 conference ran June 23-24 online, but you can still watch them all online and even fill out a participation survey and generate a certificate of attendance.</p>

  <h4><a href="http://presenters.aacconference.com/surveys/certificate">Looking for a Certificate of Attendance?</a></h4>
  <p>Check out our <a href="faq.html">FAQ for more details</a>, but we will offer certificates of attendance that you can submit for maintenance or activity hours, and sessions are available via YouTube to watch even after the conference is over.</p>
