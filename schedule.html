  <h3>AAC in the Cloud 2025 Sessions</h3>
  <p>The 2025 sessions for AAC in the Cloud are live! There may be a few last-minute tweaks, but this should get you ready! This year, because of resources constraints, many sessions are pre-recorded. We are still releasing the videos every hour, and many of the presenters will be available in the live chat, so you'll be getting double-engagement for those sessions!</p>
  <p>
    To get the most out of your time with us at AAC in the Cloud, make sure to
    <b><a href="https://join.slack.com/t/aacinthecloud/shared_invite/zt-romapz77-1S7jD6rAPGPNULJ6K5yTPQ">Join the Chat Channels</a></b>
    so you can follow the live Q&A, socialize, and find out about contests and prizes.
